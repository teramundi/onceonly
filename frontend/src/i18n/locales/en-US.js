The system is based on the concept of self-destructive messages: a sender sends a message to a recipient and that message self-destructs after the first viewing â€” if a message can only be viewed once and you are the person viewing it, then the message has not been seen by anyone but who wrote it. Through OnceOn.ly you can write messages containing sensitive information and send them to third parties, to be able to open them, they will know that the messages are leaked.',

In this case, we can be confident that someone has accessed information intended for you.

Although solutions similar to OnceOn.ly already exist and function properly in their spheres, they are a black box in the eyes of users that use them, who can not certify that their secrets are not being copied without your consent. Hence the need for a secret sharing system that was completely open source for auditing by any interested party.',
